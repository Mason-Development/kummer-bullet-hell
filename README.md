# Bullet Hell

## Setup

**You Must Do This On Every Computer You Use Unity On:** 
http://www.studica.com/blog/how-to-setup-github-with-unity-step-by-step-instructions

## Development

**NEVER PUSH DIRECTLY TO MASTER**  
you have to create a branch before you do anything  
so you create asset-design and then when it's done you can create a "pull request" at https://github.com/Mason-Development/kummer-bullet-hell/pulls  
then everyone else can look at it and Unity can evaluate it  
and if it works I or ethan will submit it
